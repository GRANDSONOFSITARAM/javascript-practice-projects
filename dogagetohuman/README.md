Dog Age to Human Age Converter 🐕
This is a simple JavaScript practice project from the Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp.

It calculates a dog's age in human years based on a specific formula.

How it Works

The script takes the dog's age as input and applies the following formula:

humanAge = ((dogAge - 2) * 4) + 21

Current Status: 🚧 Under Development

Note: I am aware there is a logic error/edge case in the current code (e.g., if the dog's age is less than 2). I am uploading this as part of my learning journey and will be pushing a fix soon to handle:

>Dogs younger than 2 years.

>Input validation (ensuring the user enters a number).
